# Workly Workshop Management (Frontend)

Welcome to Workly, a frontend-only web application designed for managing workshops and user feedback. This project provides a responsive, theme-switchable interface where users can register for workshops, submit feedback with ratings, and view their personalized dashboard. Built as a standalone client-side application, it relies on static data and does not include a backend or persistent storage—data resets on page refresh.

## 🚀 Features
- **Workshop Registration**: Register and unregister for workshops using a simple interface.
- **Feedback System**: Submit feedback with 1-5 star ratings and comments for attended workshops.
- **Personalized Dashboard**: View registered workshops and submitted feedback, filtered to the current user.
- **Theme Support**: Switch between light and dark themes using a theme context.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and effects with Framer Motion.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile views with Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or later (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm**: Included with Node.js
- **Web Browser**: A modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ridmii/workly.git
   cd workly
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Prepare Data Files**:
   - Place a data/workshops.json file in the data/ directory with workshop data in this format:
     
   ```bash
   [
   {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Modern Web Development with React",
    "description": "Explore best practices in building scalable React applications with modern tools and workflows.",
    "date": "2024-08-12",
    "location": "Colombo",
    "category": "Technology",
    "tags": ["React", "JavaScript"],
    "organizers": ["Isuru Perera", "Malsha Weerakoon"],
    "image": "/assets/react.jpg"
   }
   // Add more workshops as needed
   ]
   ```
   - Note: Feedback is transient and not loaded from a file; it resets on refresh.
  
  4. **Start the Development Server**:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     **Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the app**. Navigate to the Home page to start exploring workshops.

  ## 🧭 Usage
 
  - Home Page: Visit the root URL (/) to browse available workshops and navigate to their details.
  - Workshop Details Page: Click a workshop from the Home page to register, unregister, or leave feedback with a rating (1-5 stars) and comment. 
  - Dashboard: Navigate to /dashboard to see your registered workshops and feedback. Only the current user's feedback (identified as "CurrentUser") is displayed with stars and comments.
  - Theme Switching: Toggle themes via the ThemeContext (implementation assumed to be in place—reviewers can inspect src/context/ThemeContext.jsx).
  - Data Behavior: Feedback and registrations are lost on page refresh since this is a frontend-only app with no persistence.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- React: For building the dynamic user interface.
- React Router: For client-side navigation.
- Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
- Framer Motion: For animations and transitions.
- Vite: For fast development and bundling.

## ⚠️ Limitations 
- Frontend-Only: No backend or API integration; data is static or transient.
- No Persistence: Feedback and registrations reset on page refresh.
- Mock User: Uses a hardcoded "User" with email "user@example.com".
- Static Data: Relies on workshops.json for workshop data; no dynamic updates.

## 📝 Review Notes for GitHub Reviewers
- Scope: This is a frontend-only demo showcasing React, context management, and styling, with a deployed version on Vercel. It’s designed for learning and portfolio purposes as part of my internship selection process, featuring a Home page.
- Testing: Start at the deployed URL (e.g., https://workly-ten.vercel.app/) or locally at http://localhost:5173. Ensure public/data/workshops.json and public/assets/ images are present. Test navigation to /dashboard and /workshop/1.
- Code Quality: Review src/pages/Home.jsx for the workshop listing, src/pages/Dashboard.jsx for feedback logic, and src/context/WorkshopContext.jsx for data management. Check vercel.json for routing configuration.
- Improvements: Suggestions for adding persistence (e.g., localStorage), a backend integration, or enhancing the Home page UI are welcome!
